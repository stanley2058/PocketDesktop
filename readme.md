# Pocket Desktop

## Discription
PockDesktop is an project targeted as a desktop manager.  
Simply put all of your folders and shortcuts into a folder provided by PockDesktop.  
Then hit hotkey ```<Shift>``` + ```<Win>``` + ```<D>``` and you will see all the stuffs you just put in.  
(Hotkey can be change just by modify the code, will probably be customizable through user interface in near future.)

The project is now under construction, most of the main feature has been done.  
Just watch out for some potential bugs that hasn't be fixed.

BTW, the program icon will not show in taskbar or notification area, just hit the hotkey after starting to check it.  
The hotkey binder used in this project is from *AlexArchive's* great creation [Shortcut](https://github.com/AlexArchive/Shortcut).
